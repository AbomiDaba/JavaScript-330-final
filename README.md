1.) This project will operate in a scenario where people want to keep track of their workout regime

2.) This project seeks to solve to help those keep track of their workout regimes for those who have a hard time remembering

3.) The project will have 2 models: user and workout. There will be a signup route, login route, create workout route, delete workout route and an update route. There will be authentication to verify a user is loggedin to interact with workouts. There will be athorization to get all workouts from all users by an admin user. A reason this would be done is statistical purposes for example. No external sources or api's

4.) I will meet the project requirments by creating a authentication route to verify tokens and athorization to get all workouts from all users. Have routes to create, read, update and delete a workout. A text search function to search for workouts. I will create tests to test the crud routes along with the signup and logout routes. I will demonstrate my app using postman

5.) First week I will create the models and doa methods for the the routes as well as all the starter code for the app like setting up the server and data base. The next week I will start working on the routes and authentication and authorization. The week after I will start writing the tests and testing all the routes to ensure that they will work properly. From then on I will continue testing the app and making adjustments and changes as needed.
